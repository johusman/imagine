    <h4>
        Imagine fundamentals</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Machines and ports</b><br />
        Imagine works by adding and connecting <i>machines</i>, which are represented by
        circles with the type of the machine inscribed. Each machine has a certain set of
        input and output <i>ports</i>. Unconnected ports are not shown;
        connected ports are represented by smaller black (output) and white (input) circles.
        The exact number of input and output ports depends
        on the type of the machine.<br />
        Each connection from one machine to another starts in a certain output port of the
        first machine, and ends in a certain input port of the second machine. Thus, you
        are really connecting ports to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Opening and saving images</b><br />
        Two machines are always present in Imagine: <i>Source</i> and <i>Destination</i>.<br />
        The <i>Source</i> machine takes an image from a file and uses it as output on its single
        output port.<br />
        The <i>Destination</i> machine takes the image it receives on its single input port and
        saves it to a file. <br />
        You can determine which file is opened or saved by double clicking on the corresponding
        Source or Destination machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Generating: processing images</b><br />
        When you choose <b>Generate!</b> from the menu, images will flow between your machines along the connections you have set up.
        Different machines will process, extract or combine images in different ways, depending
        on the type of the machine. For example, the <i>Inverter</i> machine (<i>Imagine->Img->Inverter</i>)
        will take one input image and deliver as output an image that has the color and brightness
        of each pixel inverted.<br />
        The simplest thing you can do in Imagine is to connect the Source machine to the Destination
        machine. This will have the effect of copying the image from the selected source file to
        the selected destination file. More interesting image processing can be achieved by connecting
        other machines between Source and Destination.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Previewing</b><br />
        By enabling it from the <b>Options</b> menu, you can turn on the <i>Preview pane</i>.
        This pane shows a thumbnail of the image select as source image for the Source machine,
        and also a thumbnail of what the image received and saved by the Destination machine
        will look like. If there is no connecting path between Source and Destination, the
        lower image will show the last image before the connection was broken.<br />
        For clarity, the effects of some machines will be exagerated in the preview.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Two kinds of images</b><br />
        In Imagine, there are two kinds of images that can be passed between machines:
        <i>full images</i> and <i>control images</i>.<br />
        Full images are the kind of images
        you save in files; a two-dimensional array of pixels with Alpha (opacity), Red, Green
        and Blue channels. These types of images are normally the start and end product of
        an Imagine generation.<br />
        Some machines will have outputs that represent only <b>one</b> value per pixel; for
        example, the HSL Split machine outputs on separate ports the Hue, Saturation and Lightness
        of each pixel of the input image. These are not full images, for what would be the red, green
        and blue of a Saturation value? Instead, these are control images. Control images have only
        one value per pixel &mdash; they are <i>single-channel</i> images, intended to be used by
        some other machine that expects a single-channel image as input on a port. This other machine
        could perhaps be the HSL Join machine, which has input ports for Hue, Saturation and Lightness
        and builds a new full image from these as output.<br />
        Control images are internally coded as images where the red, green and blue channels have been
        supressed to zero. The single-channel value of the control image is instead encoded in the alpha
        (opacity) channel of the image.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Two kinds of machines, sort of</b><br />
        The partition into full images and control images &mdash; or, if you will, <i>full-channel</i> and
        <i>single-channel</i> images &mdash; means that certain machines expect only control images as input,
        while others expect full images as input; also, some machines give only control images as output, even
        if the input is a full images.<br />
        Because of this, some machines, such as the Inverter machine, come in two varieties: an Inverter and 
        a Control Inverter (labeled [Inverter]). The Inverter machine leaves the alpha channel of the input intact.
        The Control Inverter, on the other hand, looks <b>only</b> at the alpha channel of the input, as it
        expects a control image.<br />
        As noted above, control image versions of machines are usually labeled as the full image version, but
        enclosed in square brackets, such as [Inverter], [Gain] and [Multiply].<br />
        Choosing the correct version of the machine is critical. It is not an error to pass a full image to 
        an input expecting a control image (or vice versa), but the results may not be what you intended. On
        the other hand, if you are clever they may be <b>exactly</b> what you intended.<br />
        Finally, note that some machines expect a full image on one port <b>and</b> a control image on another
        port; this is where control images get their name, as they as then used to <i>control</i> some aspect
        of the processing of the full image, per pixel.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Graphs</b><br />
        The machines you have added and their connections are collectively called a <i>graph</i>. You can open
        and save graphs from the <b>File</b> menu, to reuse or share them with others.<br />
        When opening a graph from file, the currently selected source and destination file names will be retained.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>More machines!</b><br />
        Imagine is easily extendable with new types of machines! Creating new machines and their graphic representations
        is a topic for a completely different help text, but if you have obtained a DLL-file containing extra
        machines, you need only put it in the same directory as the Imagine.exe program, and (re)start Imagine.
        Imagine will automatically recognize and load the new machines.<br />
        If you load a graph from file which uses machines that you do not have on your system, Imagine will
        ignore them and warn you about which machines you were missing. You will almost certainly end up with
        a strangely disconnected graph, though.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>No feedback, please</b><br />
        One thing Imagine cannot (to date) handle is connections that form a <i>cycle</i> (also known as a <i>feedback loop</i>)
        where images are eternally returning to effect machines they came from. Mathematically, Imagine graphs are
        <i>Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)</i>. Imagine will complain loudly if you try to construct such a cycle.
